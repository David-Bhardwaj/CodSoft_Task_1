# CodSoft_Task_1
🎉 First Task Completed! 🎉  
I’m excited to share that I’ve completed my first task in my virtual internship at CodSoft! 💻
As part of the internship, I built a simple calculator 🧮 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that handles basic operations smoothly and efficiently—just like any regular calculator you'd use every day. It's a great feeling to see my skills in action as I kick off this journey! 🚀

Now, I’m preparing to put this project on my GitHub repository for further contribution and improvements! 🛠️

Looking forward to the next tasks and continuing to grow at CodSoft. Onward and upward! 💪
